# My Dark Twisted Business Card

With the help of many, I was able to design and print a semi-decent business card for me. And it was not a train-wreck at the end! 

So, I think it is only fair that I publish the sources and process I followed in a premissable license for others to use it and maybe achieve their own dark twisted business card fantasies. It is under the CC-0-1.0 license, basically you can do what you want with it.

## Used tools
- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) (free and open-source): main graphics editor. I haven't used it much before, but working with it was a treat! I really didn't feeling a difference between it and my memory of using Adobe Photoshop in an odd project 10 years ago.
- [Draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop) (Apache-2.0): I have used many times when preparing my PhD thesis, it is a charm to use, and I never found it limiting. I will talk about my figure generation workflow below.
- [QR Planet](https://qrplanet.com/) (Generous Freemium): For generating and managing QR codes. Lovely service. Great feature set regarding the aesthetics for generating QR codes, and they give many useful tips on printing and publishing QR codes. As a tip, make an account and cerate dynamic QR-codes instead of static ones, whose redirection address can be changed at any time, even after the card has been printed!

## Honorable mention
- [Canva.com](https://www.canva.com/): I initially started using canva.com to design the card, and it went a long way (80% of the way). I ended up aborting this direction because I was in a hurry to print and have the card. They offer templates, an online editiing tool, and a coupled printing service. In general, if you don't know or want to learn graphics editing tools like GIMP, and you don't have a local printing shop or service you already know or trust, then using canva.com as an 360 degrees solution, might be a good option. I can't vouch for their printing service becuase I did not try it.
